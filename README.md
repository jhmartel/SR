# Einstein's Special Relativity
This section includes articles on Special Relativity.

The document Einstein Spherical.pdf describes an error in Einstein's alleged proof of the Lorentz invariance of spherical light waves. 
The error can be summarized thus: radius is not a Lorentz invariant variable. 
Equivalently the class of radial solutions of the homogeneous wave equation is not a Lorentz invariant class. And again, this is because "radius" is not a proper Lorentz invariant variable.

We would upload the above article to ARXIV, however we fear the reproach of fellow mathematicians and physicists who find the idea that Einstein (and his followers) could be in error for 100+ years offensive. When we can add suitable mathematical theorems to the above article, then we shall upload the article to ARXIV. Until then, all comments and suggestions are welcome at jhmartel at protonmail dot com.
