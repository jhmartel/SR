\section{Admitted Apparent Incompatibilities at the Basis of Special Relativity}
The subject of this brief note is Einstein's alleged proof of the Lorentz invariance of spherical light waves in his special relativity theory. Our purpose here is to describe a positive gap in above mentioned proof, and to further demonstrate the untenability of its conclusions. This is a controversial subject developed by other critical authors, e.g. \cite{bryant}, \cite{crothers}. The present note arises from the author's own study of the controversy, and his attempt to identify the error in plain mathematical terms. 


We recall that the purpose of Einstein's alleged proof \cite{einstein2019relativity} is to reconcile the fundamental assumptions of special relativity, namely
\begin{itemize}

\item[(A1)] that the laws of physics are the same in all nonaccelerated reference frames, i.e. if $K'$ is a coordinate system moving uniformly (and devoid of rotation) with respect to a coordinate system $K$, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to $K'$ according to exactly the same laws as with respect to $K$. 

\item[(A2)] that light in vacuum propagates along straight lines with constant velocity $c\approx 300,000$ kilometres per second.

\end{itemize}

In Einstein's own words \cite[Ch.7, 11]{einstein2019relativity}:

\begin{quote} 
``\emph{There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school knows, or believes he knows, that this propagation takes place in straight lines with velocity $c=300, 000 km/sec$.\ldots Who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual difficulties?"} 
\end{quote}

Notice the mention of ``law" in the above quote. Einstein presents (A2) as the \emph{law} of propagation of light. To be simultaneously consistent with (A1) requires (A2) be satisfied in every nonaccelerated reference frame. However the conjunction of (A1) and (A2), abbreviated (A12), appears contradictory according to classical mechanics, Galilean transformations, and Fizeau's law of addition of velocities, etc.. However Einstein claims -- and this popularly lauded as among his greatest intellectual achievements -- that this is only an \emph{apparent} incompatibility. The incompatibility is reconciled, according to Einstein's proposal, by postulating Lorentz-Fitzgerald's length contractions and time dilations, c.f. \cite[Ch.XIV]{michelson}. What needs be shown is that Lorentz transformation preserves the form of the law (A2) in every inertial frame $K$. This requires the Lorentz invariance of luminal spherical waves, as we now discuss.   


%Recently the author has learned of the work of Tombe [ref]. 

%In section [ref] we respond to some possible objections, and submit that these two errors invalidate Einstein's argument. 

%The Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated a null effect: there was no time-variation in the interferometer, no detectable variation with respect to the aether.


%and reconciled by postulating Lorentz contractions and time dilations according to the gamma factor $\gamma=\sqrt{1+v^2/c^2}$.

%Einstein's error in the first steps of his theory has been elaborated by other authors, notably \cite{bryant}, \cite{crothers}. The present note arises from the author's own study of the controversy, and his attempt to identify the incompatibility in plain mathematical terms. In section [ref] we respond to some possible objections, and submit that these two errors invalidate Einstein's argument. 

\section{Lorentz Invariant Tensors: Existence and Nonexistence}\label{li}

The Lorentz transformations arose as a possible solution to the null effect of the Michelson-Morley experiment. The transformations relate the space- and time-coordinates $x,y,z,t$ and $\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau$ of two inertial observers $K, K'$, respectively. The key assumption is that Minkowski's line element $dx^2+dy^2+dz^2-c^2dt^2$ is invariant under Lorentz transformations. Of course $c$ is the constant luminal velocity from (A2). Here we pause to warn against the mathematician's habit of casually setting $c=1$ and treating $t$ as a space-variable immediately comparable to $x,y,z$. The constant $c$ is required to transition from units of time to units of space.  %Apples and oranges. Cannot drop the constant c and treat x,t as comparable quantities.


%The inertial observers $K, K', \ldots$ of $\bR^3$ are those reference frames, where any pair $K, K'$ of inertial observers are assumed to have a constant relative velocity. This defines the set of inertial frames in bijection with the group of affine motions $\text{Aff}(\bR^3)$ of $\bR^3$. (Formally, the inertial frames are an example of a principal $\text{Aff}(\bR^3)$-space). [Ref] 





Now we turn to our critical analysis. We claim the positive gap in Einstein's attempted proof has a twofold source. 

\textbf{Firstly, an error arises when quadratic expressions like \begin{equation}\label{a}\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2 \tau^2
\end{equation} are \emph{misidentified} with ``the equation of a sphere".}

Actually \eqref{a} is a three-dimensional cone in the four variables $\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau$. Of course the cone contains numerous spherical two-dimensional subsets, but a further equation is required. For instance the standard geometric sphere $S$ centred at the origin simultaneously satisfies \eqref{a} and the equation $$\frac{1}{2}d(\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2)=\xi d\xi+\eta d\eta +\zeta d\zeta=0.$$ In short, the standard geometric sphere requires that \emph{two}(!) quadratic forms $\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2$ and $c^2\tau^2$ be \emph{simultaneously constant}. This leads us to Einstein's second error, which is the failure to realize that \textbf{the Lorentz invariance of the quadratic form $h=x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2$ in no way implies the Lorentz invariance of the forms $h_1=x^2+y^2+z^2$ and $h_2=c^2 t^2.$ } Indeed the forms $h_1. h_2$ are positive definite, and degenerate. But if $h_1$ and $h_2$ were $G$-invariant, then $G$ would be reducible representation on $\bR^4$. 



%The argument is general and applies to split orthogonal groups of arbitrary rank, e.g. $G=SO(n,1)$,$n=1,2,3,\ldots$. %In the most basic case of $SO(1,1)$, the key observation is that a quadratic expression like $x^2=r^2$ in the $xr$-variables does not represent a ``sphere"; the expression represents a sphere of radius $r$ and only if the additional equation $\del x /\del r =0$ holds for every $x$. But the expression $\del x / \del r$ is not a tensor, i.e. satisfies no invariant 

%\section{}

If we fix a reference frame $K$, then the set of Lorentz transformations is the Lie group $G:=O(h)$ of isometries of the Minkowski form $h=x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2t^2$. Invariance says $\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2-c^2 \tau^2$ is numerically equal to $x^2+y^2+z^2-c^2 t^2$ for every Lorentz transform $\phi$ satisfying $(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau)=\phi.(x,y,z,t)$. But as we argue below, Minkowski's form is essentially the \emph{only} Lorentz invariant quadratic form on $\bR^4$. Now returning to (A12), we see Einstein's argument concerns the geometry of a wave front generated by a light pulse. That light satifies (A2) implies light trajectories are restricted to the so-called null cone $N=\{h=0\}$. Obviously $N$ is $G$-invariant and defined by the equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2$. Let $\sC$ be the vector space of (possibly degenerate) quadratic forms $q$ on $\bR^4$, and let $h\in \sC$ be Minkowski's form. 






%The Lorentz group $G$ acts linearly and irreducibly on $\bR^{3,1}=\bR^4$, so there are no proper $G$-invariant linear subspaces. 

%[Note: strictly speaking, we need prove there does not exist any nonzero quadratics $q$ whose restriction $q|_N$ to the null cone is Lorentz invariant]. 

% the Lorentz group $G$ acts linearly and irreducibly on $\bR^{3,1}=\bR^4$, so there are no proper $G$-invariant linear subspaces;

%\item the null cone $N$ contains no nonempty proper $G$-invariant subsets;

%First we observe that $N$ has no nonempty proper $G$-invariant subsets. In formal terms, if $N'\subset N$ is a nonempty $G$-invariant subset such that $N'.\phi\subset N'$ for every $\phi \in G$, then $N'=N$. Second, and more interesting is the following generalization.




\begin{thm}
If $q\in \sC$ is a quadratic form on $\bR^4$ such that the restriction $q|_N$ is $G$-invariant, then $q$ is proportional to $h$. 
\end{thm} 
\begin{proof}
The $G$-action on $N$ is transitive on nonzero vectors. Therefore if $q|_N$ is $G$-invariant, then $q|_N$ is constant. By continuity it follows that $q|_N$ is identically zero since $q(0)=0$. So the zero locus of $q$ contains the zero locus of $h$, i.e. \begin{equation}\label{c} N\subset \{q=0\}.
\end{equation}

Now we use a theorem of J. H. Elton to conclude $q$, $h$ are proportional, c.f. \cite{elton2010indefinite}. We outline his argument. Let $q\otimes_\bR \bC$ and $h\otimes_\bR \bC$ be the complexifications of the real quadratic forms $q,h$. Thus $q\otimes_\bR \bC: \bR^4 \otimes_\bR \bC \to \bC$ is a complex-valued quadratic form. Elton's proof establishes the following inclusion \begin{equation}\label{b}
\{h\otimes \bC=0\} \subset \{q\otimes \bC=0\}.
\end{equation}
According to the tensor construction we have $h\otimes \bC (x+iy)=h(x)-h(y) + 2i h(x,y)$. Therefore $h\otimes \bC(x+iy)=0$ if and only if $h(x)=h(y)$ and $h(x,y)=0$, where $h(\cdot, \cdot)$ is the bilinear form canonically defined by $h$. Elton's proof reduces to establishing the implication: if \eqref{c} is satisfied, then $h(x)=h(y)$ and $h(x,y)=0$ implies $q(x)=q(y)$ and $q(x,y)=0$ for all $x,y\in \bR^4$. That $q$ vanishes on the null cone $N$ implies $q$  is indefinite if it is not identically zero. Once the inclusion \eqref{b} is established, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz \cite{eisenbud2013commutative} implies $q\otimes \bC=\lambda \cdot h\otimes \bC$ for some $\lambda \in \bC$. But then obviously $\lambda\in \bR$ and the theorem follows.
%We have three cases supposing $h\otimes \bC(x+iy)=0$.
%Case 1: if $h(x)=0$, then $h(y)=0$. But then $h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)+2h(x,y)=0$ according to the assumptions, and it follows that $q\otimes \bC(x+iy)=0$. 
%Case 2: if $h(x)>0$, then rescaling we can choose $h(x)=1$. Since $h$ is indefinite, there exists $z$ such that $h(z)<0$
%Therefore $h\otimes \bC (x+iy)=0$ if and only if $h(x)=h(y)$ and $h(x,y)=0$. But $h(x-y)=h(x)+h(y)-2h(x,y) 
\end{proof}

 %This means there exists only one canonical quadratic form with respect to Lorentz transformations.
That is, the Minkowski form is the unique Lorentz invariant quadratic form (modulo scalars) on $\bR^4$ which vanishes on the null cone. Another argument is possible \cite{arminjon2018lorentz} which establishes nonexistence of any other Lorentz invariant $(0,2)$-tensors (the proof is long algebraic computation). Naturally the question arises whether there exist any other invariant $(p,q)$-tensors which arise independantly of the Minkowski form $h$.  

Now we return to the subject at hand, namely Einstein's alleged proof that (A12) are compatible with respect to Lorentz transforms. The argument is very general, and to illustrate we consider the two-dimensional case in the variables $x,t$. Here we find $h=x^2-c^2 t^2$ is invariant with respect to the group $G=SO(1,1)$ generated by $a_\theta:=\begin{pmatrix} \cosh \theta & \sinh \theta \\
\sinh \theta & \cosh \theta
\end{pmatrix}$, where $\theta\in \bR$. We see $SO(1,1)$ is isomorphic to the split multiplicative torus $\bR^\times _{>0}$ using the logarithm. The unit sphere includes two vectors $\langle 1, 1 \rangle,~~ \langle -1,1\rangle,$ and which are mapped by $a_\theta \in SO(1,1) \simeq \bR^\times_{>0}$ to $$\langle \xi,\tau\rangle=\langle \cosh \theta+\sinh \theta, \cosh \theta+\sinh \theta \rangle,~~ \langle -\cosh \theta+\sinh \theta, \cosh \theta-\sinh \theta \rangle.$$ But evidently $\xi^2 \neq x^2=1$ and $\tau^2 \neq t^2=1$ when $\theta\neq 0$. Thus the quadratic forms $h_1=x^2$ and $h_2=t^2$ are not invariant. Likewise we find the image of the unit sphere $x^2=1$ does not correspond to a sphere in $\xi \tau$ coordinates. %In other words the equation $x^2 = c^2 t^2$ is not the equation of sphere when $x,t$ are variable, and likewise $\xi^2=c^2 \tau^2$ is not the equation of sphere when $\xi,\tau$ are both variable and nonconstant. 
%Thus we find a gap in Einstein's purported proof. %The curious reader may consult Einstein's own words, e.g. \cite[Ch.11, pp.39]{einstein2019relativity} and verify that Einstein does not treat the general case but restricts himself to a velocity parallel to $x$-axis.  

%Moreover the algebraic expression \begin{equation}\label{a}\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2 \tau^2\end{equation} is presumed to represent the ``equation of a sphere". However, the algebraic expression \eqref{a} of four independant variables $\xi, \eta, \zeta,\tau$ does \emph{not} represent a geometric sphere unless, e.g., $$\del \tau / \del \xi=0, ~ \del \tau / \del \eta=0, \del \tau / \del \zeta=0$$ for every $\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau$ satisfying \eqref{a}. As the above two-dimensional case illustrates, this is not the case.

%Thus we find a positive gap in Einstein's argument, c.f. \cite{bryant}, \cite{crothers}. 
\section{Radius is Not a Lorentz Invariant Variable}

A dual formulation of the above observation can be phrased as follows. Consider the solutions of the homogeneous wave equation 
\begin{equation} \label{hw}
\phi_{xx}+\phi_{yy}+\phi_{zz}-\frac{1}{c^2}\phi_{tt}=0.
\end{equation} 
If $\phi$ is expressed as a function of $\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau$ using a Lorentz transformation, then evidently $\phi=\phi(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau)$ is again a solution of the homogeneous wave equation $$\phi_{\xi \xi}+\phi_{\eta \eta}+\phi_{\zeta \zeta}-\frac{1}{c^2}\phi_{\tau \tau}=0.$$ This is obvious. \textbf{However what is perhaps not obvious is that the class of \emph{radial solutions} of \eqref{hw} is \emph{not} Lorentz invariant, because indeed there is no Lorentz invariant definition of ``radius".} 

In group theoretic terms, a solution $\phi=\phi(x,t)$ of \eqref{hw} is said to be \emph{radial by an observer $K$} iff $\phi(Ax,t)=\phi(x,t)$ for every rigid motion $A\in SO(3)$ in the space variables $x,y,z$. But implicitly this requires a Lie group representation $\rho$ of $SO(3)$ into the Lorentz group $G\simeq O(3,1)$, and this representation of the maximal compact subgroup is noncanonical. Recall the quotient $G/SO(3)$ is contractible modulo a finite subgroup and a model of hyperbolic space $\bH^3$. 

Different inertial observers $K, K'$ generally choose different orthogonal symmetry groups, for instance as defined by their own "sum of squares" formula (applied to physical squares $\xi^2$, $\eta^2$, $\zeta^2$ in their local variables $\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau$). Of course the Minkowski element \eqref{a} is invariant and canonical, but any attempted decomposition into ``spatial" and ``time" parts is arbitrary choice of the observer and not Lorentz invariant. 

Furthermore, for the motion of light pulses according to (A12) the Minkowski element vanishes identically, and the only canonical tensor element becomes the constant zero element. After a Lorentz change of variables, we find a new solution $\phi'=\phi(\xi, \eta, \zeta, \tau)$, but this solution needs not be radial in the above sense. Indeed the rigid $K$-space motion $A$ does not often preserve the space coordinates $\xi, \eta, \zeta$ of $K'$, and does not act on the subspace generated by $\xi, \eta, \zeta$. That is, $A$-motions nontrivially depend on the $K'$-time variable $\tau$.
As such, we conclude the nonexistence of a Lorentz invariant radius.

%Change of variables formula would require the $G$-conjugate $\rho^g$, $g\in G$, 







\section{Objections and Response}
To conclude we briefly recall some popular objections to the above line of reasoning. The author submits this article in good faith to all honest persons, and we attempt to stimulate some critical discourse with a reasonable reader.

First one might object that our argument simply reduces to the observation that spheres in the frame $K$ are transformed to ellipsoids in $K'$, as well-known \cite[\S 4]{einstein1905electrodynamics}. But we remind the reader that the Lorentz contraction is assumed to affect \emph{material} objects, even independantly of the nature of the material, and such that material spheres in $K$ are seen as material ellipsoids in $K'$, where again the eccentricity of the $K'$-ellipsoid is nontrivial and independant of the material nature of the sphere. However we respond that light spheres are not material, and not themselves subject to Lorentz contraction if (A2) holds. At least not without further evidence and hypotheses. %Evenmore (A2) clearly requires light waves be spherical in every reference frame if they are spherical in one reference frame.

Secondly critics might object that (A12) only requires the consistent \emph{measurement} of $c$ in arbitrary reference frames $K, K'$. This would replace the formal ``law" (A2) with a more pragmatic rule of thumb for measurements. And indeed this article welcomes such an approach, and quickly we are led to an important experimental difficulty at the core of special relativity. For we remind the reader that space- and time-measurements are always dependant on material objects, and often non local, i.e. the source and receiver are possibly separated by large distances. The impossibiliy of synchronizing non local clocks leads to the apparent impossibility of measuring the ``one-way" velocity of light. It strikes the author that the incompatibility of (A12) is not merely ``apparent" but actually \emph{essential}, and even natural evidence that (A2) is not a proper natural law. That all measurements of $c$ only succeed in measuring the ``two-way" or ``round-trip" velocities of light where source and receiver coincide, is discussed in \cite{zhang1997special}, \cite{israel}. See also \cite{vid} for entertaining introduction. That is to say, we argue (A2) has never been and cannot be subject to measurement.

Thirdly, the book \cite[pp.8-10, 21-22]{rindler} attempts 
\begin{quote}
\emph{``in spite of its historical and heuristic importance, $\ldots$ to de-emphasize the logical role of the law of light propagation (A2) as a pillar of special relativity."}
\end{quote}
Rindler further claims 
\begin{quote}
\emph{``a second axiom is needed \emph{only} to determine the value of a constant $c$ of the dimensions of a velocity that occurs naturally in the theory. But this could come from any number of branches of physics -- we need only think of the energy formula $E=mc^2$, or de Broglie's velocity relation $u v =c^2$." }
\end{quote}
The above objection is interesting, and to which we have a simple response, namely that the above quoted formulas are \emph{equivalent} to (A2), and not independant in any physical sense. Even the Weber-Kohlrausch formula \cite{awk}, for example, is another form of (A2). So another independant law involving $c$ could potentially serve as a logical substitute for (A2), but this is hypothetical since no such formula appears to exist -- thus far all formulas involving $c$ are based essentially on some form of (A2). So the pillar is unmoved, logically speaking.  

Moreover the incompatibility of (A2) with the hypothesis of ``wave--particle" duality is analyzed by A.K.T. Assis \cite[\S 7.2.4, pp.133]{assis1999relational}. This is subject of future investigations.


%Fourth, there is very important observation of A.K.T. Assis that even the so-called wave-particle duality interpretation is untenable in the following sense:


%For indeed Einstein derives $E=mc^2$ from a type of ``kinetic energy" formula for massless light pulses [ref].

%Our response to this third objection is that the above formulas cannot be (and never have been) so used to identify $c^2$ as a velocity. A single formula between three variables, e.g. $E,m,c$ or $u,v,c$, cannot be used to define a variable until the remaining two variables are defined and computable. 

%Our response is that the above quoted formulas are equivalent to Weber Kroschauer formula relating electric and magnetic permittivity.

%So we rebut Rindler's third objection by indicating that apparently ``light" has a definite law, and all fundamental formulas involving light are physically equivalent to (A2) or some weaker form. 


\section{R.Sansbury's Experiment: Does Light Travel Through Space?}
Finally we think it possible that (A2) is incorrect for another reason, namely that \textbf{\emph{light} is not something that \emph{travels through space}}. The daring idea was introduced and developed by R. Sansbury, for example in his interesting book \cite{sansburyspeed}, which begins with the following experiment which we quote in full:
\begin{quote}
\emph{ (Case 1) A 15 nanosecond light pulse from a laser was sent to a light detector, 30 feet away. When the light pulse was blocked at the photodiode during the time of emission, but unblocked at the expected time of arrival, 31.2 nanoseconds after the beginning of the time of emission, for 15 nanosecond duration, little light was received. (A little more than the $4mV$ noise on the oscilloscope). This process was repeated thousands of times per second.}

\emph{(Case 2) When the light was unblocked at the photodiode during the time of emission (15 nanosecond) but blocked after the beginning of the time of emission, during the expected time of arrival for 15 nanosecond, twice as much light was received ($8mV$). This process was repeated thousands of times per second.}

\emph{This indicated that light is not a moving wave or photon, but rather the cumulative effect of instantaneous forces at a distance. That is, undetectable oscillations of charge can occur in the atomic nuclei of the photodiode that spill over as detectable oscillations of electrons after a delay.}
\end{quote}

This important experiment has apparently not been repeated, despite it's simplicity. We refer the reader to R. Sansbury's book [sic] for further details. 

%\section{Conclusion}
%This article attempts to outline inconsistencies in the foundations of Einstein's special relativity, and specifically Einstein's attempted resolution of the apparent incompatibility between (A1) and (A2). Einstein's argument suffers from two defects, as we outlined in Section \ref{li}.














%The possibility of such a fundamental error being unnoticed for more than one hundred years appears very po


%The consequences of the Michelson-Morley's null result









%Thus observation strictly supports only a weaker form (A2w) which might be formulated as follows.

%Indeed special relativity forbids the possibility of having two ``synchronized" clocks at distinct spatial positions; only ``local times" are permitted. 

%It is useful to recall an observation of F.K.T. Assis that material pendulums are even unreliable for nonlocal measurements because their oscillation periods are affected by their lengths and gravitational force [include formula]. N.B. the pendulum demonstrates time dilation without any Lorentz contraction. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[(A2w)] 
%The average velocity of every closed light trajectory, where initial and final spatial position are identical, is constant in vacuum.
%\end{itemize}

%Einstein chose to further assume that the velocity is everywhere constant along its trajectory. Admittedly this is a supposition, as he writes: 

%The convention that light travels at constant velocity $c$ during every round-trip means (A2) is replaced by (A2'): 

%And presumably the measurements that any observer $K$ might perform to test (A2) are nonlocal. Specifically, the clock by which the observer might reckon the ``velocity" of a light pulse is required to be stationary, fixed in place at the origin, e.g. Fizeau's experiments [ref], [?]. If we limit ourselves to local measurements, then the critics ought to replace (A2) with the further assumption ``that light also propagates ...". 

%But velocity is ex definitio the ratio of \emph{distance} over \emph{time}. It's possible (in logical sense) that the combination of length contraction and time dilation might yield the same measurement for all observers $K, K'$. However the material properties of both rulers and clocks make these measurements untenable. For a history of this controversy, the reader might investigate the problem of the so-called ``one-way" measurement of the speed of light. See \cite{vid} for an amusing presentation. 




%The above gap in Einstein's argument has been investigated by several critical authors, notably \cite{bryant}, \cite{crothers}. Our goal in this article has been to describe this gap in simple mathematical terms. 

%For Einstein, the purpose of his proof was to demonstrate that his so-called law of the propogation of light was indeed compatible with the principle of restricted relativity. 


% -- however it does not and a definite gap remains. 



%If Einstein's Special Relativity be falsified, where does physics stand today? This author reckons that Weber-Amp\`ere's relational electrodynamics as developed by \cite{assis1}, \cite{aw} can restore the 21st century to the correct path of investigation, and which already contains promising germs of unifying gravitation and strong nuclear forces in electrodynamics.



%For material motions the apparent incompatibilities can be resolved by postulating length contraction and time dilations in the directions of uniform velocity. However for the case of light pulses, we find the gap in Einstein's proof is an essential gap between (i) and (ii) which even Lorentz transformations do not resolve. 



%But what are the consequences of such a finding? According to Einstein, the principles of special relativity begin with Galilean relativity, namely the invariance of the laws of kinematics under affine transformations. It is apparently an experimental fact, that we can all discover, that the Laws of physics are the same in all nonaccelerated reference frames. Einstein calls this the Principle of Restricted Relativity: If $K'$ is a coordinate system moving uniformly (and devoid of rotation) with respect to a coordinate system $K$, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to $K'$ according to exactly the same laws as with respect to $K$. 

%Next Einstein claims  In view of the addition of velocities of particles, there is indeed an apparent incompatibility of the principle and the so-called law. 

%Einstein claims this apparent incompatibility can be resolved by Lorentz transformation law, i.e. by postulating length contraction and time dilation in the direction of uniform velocity. However in the case of the light pulses, the subject turns from material in motion to the transmission of light, which is hypothesized to be something that travels through space.

%I don't recall the ``speed of light being a finite constant" as a law of my youth. It was hardly mentioned as i recall. But i did wonder and stand mystified by the sun's rising and setting, moons, ...


%But there is another postulate, which Einstein adds, namely the purpotedly constant finite velocity of light (en vacuo). He even suggests that this is apparent to school children, which is doubtful. That the transmission of light was not instantaneous had been proposed according to Galileo's rough experiments (lamps at a great distance), and more strongly by Cassini/Roemer and the transits of Io across Jupiter. Thus E adds a second postulate: constant velocity of propogation of light. 

%The solution to the apparent contradiction is, according to Einstein, to modify the idea that ``distance" between two points on a rigid body is independant of the uniform motion of the reference body [ref:E, Ch 11, pp.34]. %Now Einstein clearly indicated the apparent contradiction of these two postulates, by comparing two objects in constant relative motion. For instance, a train in uniform motion relative to a fixed embankment. 

%Einstein claimed to have resolved this apparent contradiction by Lorentz transformations. I.e. by postulating length contraction and time dilation in the direction of uniform velocity, c.f. \cite{einstein2019relativity}[Ch.11, pp.39]. The reader can verify that Einstein does not treat the general case, but restricts himself to a velocity parallel to $x$-axis. Unfortunately a more detailed demonstration was left to future more critical authors, e.g. \cite{crothers}, \cite{bryant}, and nearly one hundred years expired before the gap was noticed.



% leads to the constant velocity in all inertial reference frames. However does the reader sense an inherent tension here? Length contraction is a function of material objects moving near speed of light, but not necessarily involves the contraction of light waves themselves.



%It is unfortunate that E did not give detailed demonstration, because therein he would have been disproven! But a mathematician who does not perform his calculations is like a physicist who does not perform his experiments, lest he be disproven! 

%So let us now begin the formal details: E needs formally demonstrate that the equation $r=ct$ in the $K$ frame is mapped onto $r'=c\tau$ in the $K'$ frame. In particular, as we vary over the points $p$ of the sphere $r=ct$, we need establish that the Lorentz image $p'=Lp$ under the Lorentz transformation $L$ describes a sphere in the $K'$ frame. In otherwords, and here we need be cautious, we need establish that the image radius $r'$ is constant with respect to points $p$ satisfying $r=ct$.

%There is a further error in Einstein: an erroneuous ``factorization" statement of $L=B\circ R$, where $B$ is a \emph{boost} parallel to $x$-axis, and $R$ is a \emph{spatial rotation}. [But the correct factorization is: XX]

%Lorentz group= boost along x-axis, composed with all space rotations.[error?]

%As specified by [ref], Einstein's two conditions are: 

%(I) a spherical equation is satisfied $$(x-x_0)^2+...=R^2$$

%(II) the above equation in $x,y,z,R$ defines a sphere if $R$ is constant as $x,y,z$ vary. 



%Einstein is correct that the image of $R=ct$ under Lorentz group has the form of a ``spherical equation", namely $\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2 \tau^2$; however the equation represents a sphere(!) only if the ``radius" is constant, i.e. the equation holds and both LHS and RHS are constant. 

%Consider the basic Lorentz boost along the $x$-axis at a velocity $v$. The Lorentz change of coordinates is $$\xi=\gamma (x-vt), \eta=y, \zeta=z, \tau=\gamma(t-vx/c^2), $$ where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. We assume $x,y,z,$ are constrained to the sphere $(x-x_0)^2+..=R^2$.

%Now Einstein is correct that we have $$x^2+y^2+...=c^2 t^2$$ and also $$\xi^2+..=c^2 \tau^2,$$ according to the Lorentz transformation.

%If $t,\tau$ are constant, then both equations represent spheres. However, and this is key point, we observe that $\tau$ is not constant with respect to $x,y,z$. This is made evident by the following computation, which [E] neglects to perform in [ref]: namely $dR'/dx$ is nonzero, even when $x$ is constrained to the sphere $R=ct$. This is key computation which [E] neglects to perform.

%By chain rule, $$\frac{dR'}{dx}=\frac{dR'}{d\tau} \frac{d\tau}{dx}+\frac{dR'}{d\zeta} \frac{d\zeta}{dx}\frac{dR'}{d\nu} \frac{d\nu}{dx}\frac{dR'}{d\xi} \frac{d\xi}{dx},$$ and which according to Lorentz transformation [ref], is equal to $-(v/c)\gamma$. Since this expression is decidedly nonzero, it follows that the radius $R'$ is non constant. 

%Counter arguments: (i) aspects of relativity, such as simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, are already experimentally valid. 

%(ii) the Lorentz image of the sphere is the view relative an observer in $K$ (and which image is not a sphere, but elliptical), whereas the Lorentz image is ``correct" (i.e. spherical) for a $K'$ observer.
